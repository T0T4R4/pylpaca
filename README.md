## Pylpaca (ASCOM Alpaca API micro-framework for Python)

pylpaca is a python implementation of the [ASCOM](https://ascom-standards.org/) driver interfaces and the [ASCOM Alpaca API](https://ascom-standards.org/api).

It is built on top of the [Tornado microframework](http://www.tornadoweb.org), and code has been borrowed from the [Tornado-Rest](https://github.com/rancavil/tornado-rest) project (Acknoledgments to their authors).
This framework allows you to wrap around your custom astronomy device driver (Telescope, Dome, Camera...) , so that they can be called by simple Http requests.

Pylpaca works with Python 3+.

**Attention** Under development, not mature to be used yet. Watch this repository and come back when this readme file will state that the framework is ready to use.
